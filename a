* [33m3f27920[m[33m ([m[1;33mtag: v0.1[m[33m)[m Reports added
* [33m230e362[m[33m ([m[1;33mtag: test-lw[m[33m)[m Report for employees added. The other reports just need a similar implementation. However, I need to manage the date and times part. Besides, I have some things half baked like the edit in the list, as I did a section to edit :c Welp
* [33m5d4b2e8[m Double click event, just in case i forget
* [33m3ea8094[m Comparable and Comparator added. Need to test the comparator, though
* [33md22165b[m Clients are added in order
* [33m4a47b35[m Report menu added / Bubble sort for ingredients and insertion sort for types added
* [33m1a5ba7a[m Recover or change password added

* [33m114b306[m TI1 Entrega 1
* [33m6c8f425[m Orders can now be added
* [33md141ae1[m All objects can be listed now
* [33m73db5ff[m Enable/Disable functional. Deleting an object functional (Just for the products and ingredients, as I haven't validated the clients and employees in the orders). 5 things needed, List each object, Generating reports, adding the order functionality, implementing the course stuff, sorts, binary search, comparable and comparator, etc. And, finally, fixing, if there is something to fix, in the inheritance part.
* [33mc4286be[m Serializable version changed. Added Enable/Disable interface, still coding it
* [33m27cf7a5[m Employee, Add/Edit/Delete. Still need to add orders, reports and disable objects.
* [33mf903d3b[m Data persistence added. Though, employees / orders and reports. As well as disabling the objects have not been added. (I probably still need to fix the inheritance issue)
* [33mab8d27e[m Now it is possible to add, edit and delete products, clients, ingredients and types of products. I still need to add the reports, employees and probably not delete the objects and instead disable them. Also, I still can improve the methods and fix the inheritance issue
* [33mb8cdf93[m Added the possibility to fully edit the Client (attributes different from the id) and the ingredients
* [33m1022b08[m Added the list/edit of each object. Still need to fix the weird inheritance issue
* [33m226bc23[m Split GoldenHouseMainGUI in three different controllers. There are some errors and bad practices, though. I'm gonna make it work and then fix it
* [33m3e2760a[m Now clients can be added
* [33mbd87f14[m Add products / ingredients and types available. Needed createdBy and LastModifiedBy in product
